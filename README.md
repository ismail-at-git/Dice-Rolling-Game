üé≤ Dice Rolling Game ‚Äì Project Description

A simple yet engaging web application that simulates a dice roll, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random number between 1 and 6 when the user clicks a button, visually updating the dice face accordingly. It's an excellent beginner-level project to understand how to manipulate the DOM and work with basic logic in JavaScript.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

HTML5: Structured the layout and content of the page including the dice image and roll button.

CSS3: Styled the game interface, including responsive layout and hover effects to enhance user interaction.

JavaScript (Vanilla):

Used Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate a random dice value (1‚Äì6).

Manipulated the DOM to dynamically change the dice image based on the random number.

Handled user interaction through addEventListener to trigger the roll function on button click.

üìö What I Learned:

How to structure a basic interactive web page using semantic HTML.

Styling techniques with CSS to make the layout visually appealing and responsive.

Core JavaScript concepts including:

Random number generation

Event handling

DOM manipulation

Conditional logic for updating UI elements

Improved debugging and problem-solving skills while testing and refining game functionality.
